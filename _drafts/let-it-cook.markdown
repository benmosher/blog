title: "Let It Cook."
---

This is a post that I will write over several days, in several sessions. This is part of an exercise in "letting it cook."

The specifics in my mind around this idea center around two key things:

About a year or so ago, I started throwing away drafts of social media posts at least as often as I actually post them. This is tweets, comments, etc.

It was not so much a hard threshold as a consequence of just looking at the post content and considering: would I want to read this? would I be _glad_ I had read it?

More often than not: nope.

The other contributor is a blog post I read called ['Give it five minutes.']](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes), the core idea being: don't immediately react to new, potentially unfamiliar or uncomfortable ideas.

Let it cook. Let it simmer in your mind. The knee-jerk reaction is likely not the best one.



As an aside: a consequence of hosting this blog on GitHub is that I will probably end up pushing drafts of these posts as commits, even if they are not ever 'published' to the site proper. No such thing as a 'private draft' in this brave, new world of open-source blogging.
